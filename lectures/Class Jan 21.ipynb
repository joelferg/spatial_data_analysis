    "This notebook will introduce us to the most basic shape, the point, and how it is implemented in python. We'll then make collections of points in the same coordinate system and show how we can make data structures that tell python \"this collection of points all lives in the same space and uses the same coordinate system\". In GIS software generally, the coordinate systems are typically called \"Coordinate Reference Systems\" (CRSs). We'll also demonstrate how the order of indices matters and how to check what each index refers to for a particular CRS. We'll see how you can both set the CRS and how to change to another CRS over the same space. We'll also demonstrate what we saw in class on Tuesday: that going back and forth between coordinate systems is safe because they are unique.\n",

    "## Coordinate System Transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "On Tuesday, we learned that because coordinate systems assign unique coordinates to all locations in a space, we can safely go back and forth between different coordinate systems as long as they describe the same space. Let's see this in action.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to learn how to implement a coordinate system transformation. Fortunately, the `to_crs` [method](https://geopandas.org/en/latest/docs/reference/api/geopandas.GeoDataFrame.to_crs.html#geopandas.GeoDataFrame.to_crs) of `geopandas.GeoDataFrame`s makes this incredibly simple. Let's take our `gdf` in WGS 84 and put it into [Web Mercator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Mercator_projection) (EPSG:3857), another really common CRS (it's what Google Maps uses). Web Mercator also has the nice feature that distances are measured in meters, rather than degrees, so performing this kind of transformation is often really useful. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we implement the transformation, let's save a copy of the original point values so we can compare the final result. Making a new column for a `pandas.DataFrame` or `geopandas.GeoDataFrame` is similar to adding a new entry to a dictionary. Here, the \"key\" is the column name and the \"value\" is the list of values for each row. In this case, we'll just access the \"point\" column and make a new column called \"original_point\" that contains those same values. One detail of this is that sometimes when things are shared, like how the \"point\" and \"original_point\" columns will be the same, pandas and geopandas save memory by assuming they will always be the same, which can cause issues sometimes. To get around this, we'll add `.copy()` to the end to tell it explicity that they won't be the same forever."

    "Note that this was not \"undo\"ing the first transformation: we first transformed from WGS 84 to Web Mercator, then from Web Mercator to WGS 84. The fact that we got back to where we started is precisely because coordinate systems assign unique coordinates to all locations. There are certain cases where, because of the finite precision of the way numbers are represented in computers, you can end up in a slightly different place, but this \"error\" will almost always be extremely small."
